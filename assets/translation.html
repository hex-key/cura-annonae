        <h4>Ch. 47</h4>

        <p class="latin"><strong>1</strong> Panibus urbis Romae unciam de Aegyptio vectigali auxit, ut quadam epistula data ad praefectum annonae urbis etiam ipse gloriatur: </p>
        <p class="english">He increased [the size of] the bread of the Roman city by a small amount using the taxes from Egypt, which he himself brags about in a letter given to the <i>praefectum annonae</i> of the city [Rome]: </p>

        <p class="latin"><strong>2</strong> "Aurelianus Augustus Flavio Arabiano praefecto annonae. inter cetera, quibus dis faventibus Romanam rem publicam iuvimus, nihil mihi est magnificentius quam quod additamento unciae omne annonarum urbicarum genus iuvi. </p>
        <p class="english">"[From] Aurelian Augustus to Flavius Arabianus the <i>praefecto annonae</i>. Between the different [things], by which we help the public affairs of Rome <strong>with the aid of gods</strong>, nothing is more magnificent to me than that by adding a small amount I increased all kinds of grain for the city. </p>

        <p class="latin"><strong>3</strong> quod ut esset perpetuum, navicularios Niliacos apud Aegyptum novos et Romae amnicos posuit, Tiberinas exstruxi ripas, vadum alvei tumentis effodi, dis et Perennitati vota constitui, almam Cererem consecravi. </p>
        <p class="english">So that this might be lasting, I have positioned new boats on the Nile in Egypt and the rivers in Rome, I have raised up the banks of the Tiber, <strong>I have made vows to the gods and the perennial [harvest], I have consecrated [a statue of] the nourishing Ceres</strong>. </p>

        <p class="latin"><strong>4</strong> nunc tuum est officium, Arabiane iucundissime, elaborare ne meae dispositiones in irritum veniant. neque enim populus Romanus saturo quicquam potest esse laetius." </p>
        <p class="english">Now it is your job, dearest Arabianus, to endeavor so that my works may not be vain. For nothing can make me happier than the Roman people being fed." </p>
        <br>

        <h4>Ch. 48</h4>

        <p class="latin"><strong>1</strong> Statuerat et vinum gratuitum populo Romano dare, ut, quemadmodum oleum et panis et porcina gratuita praebentur, sic etiam vinum daretur, quod perpetuum hac dispositione conceperat. </p>
        <p class="english">He decided to also give free wine to the Roman people, so that, in the way that oil and bread and pork were supplied for free, wine would also be given, [and] he devised it with this arrangement so that it would be lasting. </p>

        <p class="latin"><strong>2</strong> Etruriae per Aureliam usque ad Alpes maritimas ingentes agri sunt iique fertiles ac silvosi. statuerit igitur dominis locorum incultorum, qui tamen vellent, pretia dare atque illic familias captivas constituere, vitibus montes conserere atque ex eo opere vinum dare, ut nihil redituum fiscus acciperet, sed totum populo Romano concederet. facta erat ratio dogae, cuparum, navium et operum. </p>
        <p class="english">In Etruria, along the Aurelian Way until the Maritime Alps there are large farmlands both fertile and wooded. Thus he decided to give payment to the households in the uncultivated lands, if they were willing, in order to relocate the families of captured people [prisoners of war, slaves] there, and to plant vines on the mountains to give wine from this way, such that the treasury would receive no yields, but it would all be granted to the people of Rome. He had made a plan for the vats, casks, ships, and labor. </p>

        <p class="latin"><strong>3</strong> sed multi dicunt Aurelianum ne id faceret praeventum, alii a praefecto praetorii suo prohibitum, qui dixisse fertur: "Si et vinum populo Romano damus, superest ut et pullos et anseres demus." </p>
        <p class="english">But many say Aurelian was prevented so that he might not have done this, others [say that] he was blocked by his prefect of the guard, who is said to have commented: "If we also give wine to the Roman people, it is left over only to give them chickens and geese." </p>

        <p class="latin"><strong>4</strong> argumento est id vere Aurelianum cogitasse, immo etiam facere disposuisse vel ex aliqua parte fecisse, quod in porticibus Templi Solis fiscalia vina ponuntur, non gratuita populo eroganda sed pretio. </p>
        <p class="english">There is indeed evidence Aurelian was thinking of [doing] this, or rather that he was arranging to do it or even did part of it, because in the porticos of the Temple of the Sun the wine of the treasury is given, not for free to the people but with a price being paid. </p>

        <p class="latin"><strong>5</strong> sciendum tamen congiaria illum ter dedisse, donasse etiam populo Romano tunicas albas manicatas ex diversis provinciis et lineas Afras atque Aegyptias puras, ipsumque primum donasse oraria populo Romano, quibus uteretur populus ad favorem. </p>
        <p class="english">It must be known, however, that he gave gifts [money] to them three times, and also gave the Roman people white long-sleeved tunics from different provinces and pure African and Egyptian linens, and he himself first gave scarves to the people of Rome, which were to be used to show support. </p>

            123 BC, Gaius Gracchus and Lex Licinia

            Was originally just a price ceiling of 6 â…“ asses for one modius (unit of measure) of grain, eventual policy was that adult male landowners with income/property under a certain line could buy 33 kg of subsidized grain at five modii (currency)

            Gaius also implemented the lex agraria land redistribution law that caused Tiberius Gracchus to be murdered - it essentially had the state buy land from wealthy people and gave it to poor people

            100 BC - 27 BC, Clodius, Caesar, Pompey, aediles Cereales

            Originally about 40,000 people were eligible 

            58 BC - Clodius increased to 320,000 and made them free instead of being a price ceiling

            -- Citizens pushed for Pompey to have more powers to deal with pirates who threatened the grain supply

            44 BC - Caesar decreased to 150,000 

            Caesar appointed two Aediles Cereales to be in charge of storage and distribution

            Period characterized by people beginning to view feeding the citizens as one of the government's self-evident jobs

        <h3><i>Cura Annonae</i></h3>

        <p>
            <i>Cura annonae</i>, directly translated as "care of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annona_(mythology)">Annona</a>," was the grain distribution system active in Ancient Rome from approximately the year 123 BC to the empire's dissolution. It aimed to provide Roman citizens with enough grain to sustain themselves, something difficult to achieve for many due to inconsistent harvests and civil wars. Many consider it the precursor to present-day social welfare programs like food stamps, universal basic income, and social security. This essay will provide an overview of the system's history and analyze its political and religious underpinnings.
        </p>

        <p>
            The earliest form of the system was proposed by a tribune named Gaius Gracchus in 123 BC and allowed around 40,000 poor Roman citizens to buy a certain amount of grain per month at a subsidized price. In 58 BC, the tribune Publius Clodius Pulcher increased the number of eligible people to 320,000 and made the grain free rather than subsidized. Pompey was appointed <i>praefectus annonae</i> in 57 BC when piracy resulted in shortages and civil unrest, cementing the provision of a stable food source as a core function of the state. This position was responsible for managing the shipment and storage of grain from colonies/provinces and allocating funds for the dole. When Caesar seized power in 49 BC, he decreased the number of eligible people to 150,000, but also appointed two <i>Aediles Cereales</i> to manage the storage and distribution of grain.

        <p>
            Augustus (Octavian) initially disapproved of the grain dole, believing that using public funds for it was unethical as it would cause citizens to become lazy and overly reliant on the government. However, he continued to support it <a href="https://www.thelatinlibrary.com/resgestae.html#:~:text=populum%20universum%20liberarem-,impensa%20et%20cura%20mea,-.%20Consulatum%20quoque%20tum">using his personal funds</a> since he realized that, due to its popularity, it would likely be reinstated if he were to dismantle it. The number of eligible citizens was adjusted to 200,000. He also created the <i>praefectus frumenti dandi</i> senatorial position, which was responsible for the physical distribution of the grain.

        <p>
            Claudius and Nero, the last two emperors of the Julio-Claudian dynasty, created the deified figure Annona as the personification of the grain supply system. She was used commonly in government propaganda and iconography, and eventually began to receive dedications and votive offerings similarly to other deities. Annona symbolized the idea that the government - specifically Imperial rule - would provide abundance, stability and safety for Roman citizens. Trajan also later used her to represent Rome's grain independence from Egypt. In this way, the <i>Cura Annonae</i> began to be seen as a divine power of the government. 
        </p>

        <p>
            This treatment of government provision as a religious function only intensified over time. Emperor Aurelian, in a letter to his <i>praefectum annonae</i>, used language such as "help the public affairs of Rome with the aid of gods" and includes religious concepts like vows and the consecration of statues in his description of his reinforcements of the system. This letter was likely not meant to be publicized (although it's impossible to be sure), suggesting that the religious facets of the system were much more than just for publicity and that the grain dole genuinely became a part of how Roman leaders viewed their duties.

        <p>
            Overall, the <i>Cura Annonae</i> was an elaborate system sometimes used to garner public support and other times to gain political/military power. It was also successful in its stated aim of ensuring most Romans would be able to get by even if they didn't have the means to do so at the time. Some, such as the poet Juvenal–who coined the phrase "bread and circuses" and used it to describe the subsidized food and entertainment provided by the Roman state–were critical, but it was mostly regarded as a critical part of the Empire that persisted well into the Byzantine era, and its popularity was not least due to the religious messaging that accompanied it.

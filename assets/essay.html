        <h3><i>Cura Annonae</i></h3>

        <p>
            <i>Cura annonae</i>, directly translated as "care of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annona_(mythology)">Annona</a>," was the grain distribution system active in Ancient Rome from approximately the year 123 BC to the empire's dissolution. It aimed to provide Roman citizens with enough grain to sustain themselves, something difficult to achieve for many due to inconsistent harvests and civil wars. Many consider it the precursor to present-day social welfare programs like food stamps, universal basic income, and social security. This essay will provide an overview of the system's history and analyze its political and religious underpinnings.

            The earliest form of the system was proposed by a tribune named Gaius Gracchus in 123 BC and allowed around 40,000 poor Roman citizens to buy a certain amount of grain per month at a subsidized price. In 58 BC, the tribune Publius Clodius Pulcher increased the number of eligible people to 320,000 and made the grain free rather than subsidized. Pompey was appointed <i>praefectus annonae</i> in 57 BC when piracy resulted in shortages and civil unrest, cementing the provision of a stable food source as a core function of the state. This position was responsible for managing the shipment and storage of grain from colonies/provinces and allocating funds for the dole. When Caesar seized power in 49 BC, he decreased the number of eligible people to 150,000, but also appointed two <i>Aediles Cereales</i> to manage the storage and distribution of grain.

            Augustus (Octavian) initially disapproved of the grain dole, believing that using public funds for it was unethical as it would cause citizens to become lazy and overly reliant on the government. However, he continued to support it <a href="https://www.thelatinlibrary.com/resgestae.html#:~:text=populum%20universum%20liberarem-,impensa%20et%20cura%20mea,-.%20Consulatum%20quoque%20tum">using his personal funds</a> since he realized that, due to its popularity, it would likely be reinstated if he were to dismantle it. The number of eligible citizens was adjusted to 200,000. He also created the <i>praefectus frumenti dandi</i> senatorial position, which was responsible for the physical distribution of the grain.

            Claudius and Nero, the last two emperors of the Julio-Claudian dynasty, created the deified figure Annona as the personification of the grain supply system. She was used commonly in government propaganda and iconography, and eventually began to receive dedications and votive offerings similarly to other deities. Annona symbolized the idea that the government - specifically Imperial rule - would provide abundance, stability and safety for Roman citizens. Trajan also later used her to represent Rome's grain independence from Egypt. In this way, the <i>Cura Annonae</i> began to be seen as a divine power of the government.

            it was an elaborate system sometimes used to garner public support sometimes to gain political power sometimes to simply quell unrest and promote stability and sometimes for the military.
